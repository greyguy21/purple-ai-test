  "form-field-multiple-labels": "To ensure a form field does not have multiple label elements, you should use only one label element and associate it with the form field using the \"for\" attribute. The \"for\" attribute should have the same value as the \"id\" attribute of the form field.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Single Label Example</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <form>\n    <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" required>\n    \n    <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n    <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" required>\n    \n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n  </form>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, we have two form fields: \"username\" and \"password\". Each field has a single label element associated with it using the \"for\" attribute. The \"for\" attribute value matches the \"id\" attribute value of the respective form field. This ensures that each form field has only one label element."
