  "form-field-multiple-labels": "To ensure a form field does not have multiple label elements, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Use only one `<label>` element for each form field.\n2. Use the `for` attribute in the `<label>` element to associate it with the corresponding form field using the field's `id` attribute.\n3. If you need to provide additional information or instructions for the form field, use other elements such as `<span>` or `<p>` with appropriate styling.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<style>\n  .additional-info {\n    font-size: 0.9em;\n    color: gray;\n  }\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<form>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\">\n    <!-- Use a <span> element for additional information instead of another <label> -->\n    <span class=\"additional-info\">(Minimum 6 characters)</span>\n  </div>\n  \n  <div>\n    <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n    <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\">\n    <!-- Use a <p> element for instructions instead of another <label> -->\n    <p class=\"additional-info\">Password must contain at least one number, one uppercase and one lowercase letter, and at least 8 characters.</p>\n  </div>\n  \n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n</form>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, each form field has only one `<label>` element associated with it using the `for` attribute. Additional information and instructions are provided using `<span>` and `<p>` elements with a specific class for styling."
