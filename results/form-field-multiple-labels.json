  "form-field-multiple-labels": "To ensure a form field does not have multiple label elements, you should associate only one label element with the form field using the \"for\" attribute in the label element and the \"id\" attribute in the form field.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Form Example</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<form action=\"/submit\" method=\"post\">\n  <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" required>\n  <br><br>\n  <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n  <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" required>\n  <br><br>\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n</form>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, the form has two fields: \"username\" and \"password\". Each field has only one label element associated with it:\n\n- The \"Username\" label has the \"for\" attribute set to \"username\", which corresponds to the \"id\" attribute of the username input field.\n- The \"Password\" label has the \"for\" attribute set to \"password\", which corresponds to the \"id\" attribute of the password input field.\n\nBy using this method, you can ensure that each form field has only one label element associated with it, which helps maintain accessibility and usability standards."
