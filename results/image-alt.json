  "image-alt": "To make an image element accessible to screen readers, you can use the `alt` attribute to provide a text description of the image or use the `aria-label` attribute to give it an accessible name.\n\nExample using the `alt` attribute:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" alt=\"A description of the image for screen readers\">\n```\n\nExample using the `aria-label` attribute:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" aria-label=\"A description of the image for screen readers\">\n```\n\nFor images that have a role of `none` or `presentation`, they are considered decorative and should not have any accessible name or description. This means that screen readers will ignore them.\n\nExample using the `role` attribute with a value of `none`:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"decorative-image.jpg\" role=\"none\" alt=\"\">\n```\n\nExample using the `role` attribute with a value of `presentation`:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"decorative-image.jpg\" role=\"presentation\" alt=\"\">\n```\n\nIn both examples above, the `alt` attribute is empty, indicating that the image is decorative and should not be announced by screen readers."
