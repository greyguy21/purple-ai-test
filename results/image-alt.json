  "image-alt": "To ensure an image element is accessible to screen readers, you can use the `alt` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute. The `alt` attribute is used to provide a text alternative for the image, while the `aria-label` attribute is used to define a string that labels the current element.\n\nExample with `alt` attribute:\n```html\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" alt=\"A description of the image\" />\n```\n\nExample with `aria-label` attribute:\n```html\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" aria-label=\"A description of the image\" />\n```\n\nFor image elements with a role of `none` or `presentation`, you can use the following snippets:\n\nExample with `role=\"none\"`:\n```html\n<img src=\"decorative-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" role=\"none\" />\n```\n\nExample with `role=\"presentation\"`:\n```html\n<img src=\"decorative-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" />\n```\n\nIn both examples, the `alt` attribute is set to an empty string, which indicates that the image is decorative and should be ignored by screen readers. The `role` attribute is set to either `none` or `presentation` to reinforce this."
