  "image-alt": "To make an image element accessible to screen readers, you can use the `alt` attribute to provide a text description of the image or the `aria-label` attribute to give it a label. Here's an example of both:\n\nUsing the `alt` attribute:\n```html\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" alt=\"A description of the image for screen readers\">\n```\n\nUsing the `aria-label` attribute:\n```html\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" aria-label=\"A label for the image for screen readers\">\n```\n\nFor image elements with the role of `none` or `presentation`, you can use the `role` attribute and leave the `alt` attribute empty. Here are examples of both cases:\n\nImage with the role of `none`:\n```html\n<img src=\"decorative.jpg\" role=\"none\" alt=\"\">\n```\n\nImage with the role of `presentation`:\n```html\n<img src=\"decorative.jpg\" role=\"presentation\" alt=\"\">\n```\n\nThese snippets indicate that the image is purely decorative and should be ignored by screen readers."
