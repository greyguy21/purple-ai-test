  "button_aria-label_aria-paused_aria-playing": "<button aria-label=\"Play big screen video\" aria-pressed=\"false\" aria-describedby=\"status\">Play</button>\n<button aria-label=\"Pause big screen video\" aria-pressed=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"status\">Pause</button>\n\nExplanation: \n- The `aria-label` attribute should provide a concise label for the button, without including unnecessary information like \"...\".\n- The `aria-paused` and `aria-playing` attributes are not valid ARIA attributes for a button. Instead, we can use `aria-pressed` to indicate whether the button is currently playing or paused.\n- We can also add an `aria-describedby` attribute to provide additional information about the button's status, such as whether it is currently playing or paused."
