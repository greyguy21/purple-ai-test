  "aria-dialog-name": "To ensure that each element with role=\"dialog\" or role=\"alertdialog\" has either an aria-label attribute or an aria-labelledby attribute, follow these steps:\n\n1. Add an appropriate label to the dialog element using either the `aria-label` attribute or the `aria-labelledby` attribute.\n\nOption 1: Using `aria-label` attribute:\n\n- Add a brief, descriptive label to the `aria-label` attribute directly on the element with the role of \"dialog\" or \"alertdialog\".\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"dialog\" aria-label=\"User settings\" id=\"some-id\"></div>\n```\n\nOption 2: Using `aria-labelledby` attribute:\n\n- Add an `id` attribute to a visible text element within the dialog that serves as the label for the dialog.\n- Add the `aria-labelledby` attribute to the element with the role of \"dialog\" or \"alertdialog\", and set its value to the `id` of the text element that serves as the label.\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"dialog-label\" id=\"some-id\">\n  <h2 id=\"dialog-label\">User settings</h2>\n  <!-- Other dialog content -->\n</div>\n```\n\n2. Verify that all elements with role=\"dialog\" or role=\"alertdialog\" have either an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.\n\n- Check your HTML code to ensure that each element with the role of \"dialog\" or \"alertdialog\" has either an `aria-label` attribute or an `aria-labelledby` attribute, as shown in the examples above.\n\n3. Test the accessibility of the dialog elements.\n\n- Use a screen reader or an accessibility testing tool to check that the labels are read correctly by assistive technologies.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that each element with role=\"dialog\" or role=\"alertdialog\" has an appropriate label that is accessible to screen reader users and complies with accessibility guidelines."
