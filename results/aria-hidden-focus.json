  "div_aria-describedby_aria-hidden_role_style_tabindex": "To ensure that the `aria-hidden` elements are not focusable and do not contain focusable elements, you should remove the `tabindex` attribute or set it to `-1`. This will prevent the element from being focusable. Additionally, make sure that any focusable elements within the `div` have their `tabindex` set to `-1` as well.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```html\n<div aria-describedby=\"...\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"tabpanel\" style=\"width: 278px;\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n  <!-- Make sure any focusable elements inside the div also have tabindex=\"-1\" -->\n</div>\n```\n\nBy setting `tabindex` to `-1`, the element and its focusable children will be removed from the normal tab order, making them inaccessible to keyboard users."
