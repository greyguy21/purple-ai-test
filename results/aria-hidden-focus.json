Remove the `tabindex` attribute or set `tabindex=\"-1\"` on the element itself. This will make the element unfocusable.\n\n```html\n<div aria-describedby=\"...\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"tabpanel\" style=\"width: 278px;\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n```\n\n2. Ensure that any focusable elements within the `aria-hidden` element also have `tabindex=\"-1\"`. This will make them unfocusable as well.\n\n```html\n<div aria-describedby=\"...\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"tabpanel\" style=\"width: 278px;\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n  <!-- Focusable elements within the aria-hidden element -->\n  <a href=\"#\" tabindex=\"-1\">Link</a>\n  <button tabindex=\"-1\">Button</button>\n  <input type=\"text\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n</div>\n```\n\nBy doing these steps, you will ensure that the `aria-hidden` element and its focusable children are not focusable by keyboard navigation or other assistive technologies.",

This will prevent the element and its focusable children from being included in the tab order.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```html\n<li aria-controls=\"navigation01\" aria-hidden=\"true\" aria-selected=\"false\" role=\"presentation\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n  <button aria-required=\"false\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"-1\" type=\"button\"></button>\n</li>\n```\n\nBy setting `tabindex=\"-1\"` on both the `li` element and the `button` element, they will not be focusable by keyboard navigation.",
  "div_aria-hidden_style_tabindex": "To ensure that an element with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` is not focusable and does not contain any focusable elements, you should add the `tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute to the element and to all its focusable child elements. This will prevent them from being included in the tab order and receiving focus.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width: 290px;\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n  <p>Some content...</p>\n  <a href=\"#\" tabindex=\"-1\">A link that should not be focusable</a>\n  <button tabindex=\"-1\">A button that should not be focusable</button>\n  <input type=\"text\" tabindex=\"-1\" />\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `div` element and all its focusable child elements (link, button, and input) have the `tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute, ensuring that they are not focusable."
