  "landmark-one-main": "A main landmark is a way to identify the primary content area of a web page, making it easier for assistive technologies like screen readers to navigate the page. To ensure a document has a main landmark, you can use the HTML5 `<main>` element or use ARIA roles.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `<main>` element:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <title>Example Page with Main Landmark</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <header>\n    <nav>\n      <!-- Navigation menu goes here -->\n    </nav>\n  </header>\n\n  <main>\n    <h1>Primary Content Heading</h1>\n    <p>This is the main content of the page. All the primary content should be placed inside the main element to ensure it's identified as the main landmark.</p>\n    <!-- More primary content goes here -->\n  </main>\n\n  <aside>\n    <!-- Sidebar content goes here -->\n  </aside>\n\n  <footer>\n    <!-- Footer content goes here -->\n  </footer>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `<main>` element is used to wrap the primary content of the page, ensuring that the document has a main landmark.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the ARIA `role` attribute with the value \"main\" to achieve the same result:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"main\">\n  <h1>Primary Content Heading</h1>\n  <p>This is the main content of the page. All the primary content should be placed inside the element with the role=\"main\" attribute to ensure it's identified as the main landmark.</p>\n  <!-- More primary content goes here -->\n</div>\n```\n\nNote that using the `<main>` element is recommended, as it provides better semantics and is more widely supported by assistive technologies. However, the ARIA `role` attribute can be used as a fallback when the `<main>` element is not available or supported."
