  "svg-img-alt": "1. Add a descriptive title to the SVG element using the `<title>` tag. This will provide context to the screen reader user about what the SVG represents.\n\n2. Use the `aria-label` attribute to provide a short, descriptive label for the SVG element. This will help screen reader users understand the purpose of the SVG element.\n\n3. Include a `desc` element within the SVG to provide a more detailed description of the SVG element. This can be helpful for complex SVGs that may require more explanation.\n\n4. Use meaningful text for the `fill` attribute. For example, instead of using \"some-fill\", use a descriptive name like \"red\" or \"blue\".\n\n5. Ensure that the SVG is properly structured with appropriate use of `<g>` (group) and `<use>` elements. This will help screen readers navigate the SVG more easily.\n\n6. Use the `tabindex` attribute to make the SVG element focusable. This will allow keyboard users to easily navigate to the SVG element.\n\n7. Optimize the SVG for performance by reducing unnecessary elements and attributes. This will help improve the overall accessibility of the SVG."
