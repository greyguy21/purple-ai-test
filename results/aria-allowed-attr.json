  "span_aria-label": "To ensure ARIA attributes are allowed for an element's role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the element's role: In this case, the element is a `<span>` which has no specific role by default. You can add a role to the element using the `role` attribute, e.g., `<span role=\"button\" aria-label=\"...\"></span>`.\n\n2. Check the ARIA specification: Consult the WAI-ARIA specification to see which ARIA attributes are allowed for the given role. You can find the specification at https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/.\n\n3. Verify the attribute is allowed: In the ARIA specification, find the section for the role you have assigned to the element. Check the list of allowed ARIA attributes for that role. If the attribute you want to use (in this case, `aria-label`) is listed, then it is allowed for the element's role.\n\n4. Add the attribute to the element: If the ARIA attribute is allowed for the element's role, add it to the element in your HTML code. Make sure the attribute value is meaningful and accurately describes the element's purpose or function. For example, `<span role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Submit Form\"></span>`.\n\n5. Test with a screen reader: Use a screen reader or other assistive technology to ensure the ARIA attribute is correctly applied and understood by the software. This will help you confirm that the attribute is allowed for the element's role and is providing the intended accessibility benefits.",
  "div_aria-label": "To ensure ARIA attributes are allowed for an element's role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the element's role: Check if the element has a default role or an explicitly assigned role using the `role` attribute. In this case, the element is a `<div>`, which doesn't have a default role. If a role is not explicitly assigned, it's considered a generic container.\n\n2. Check ARIA attribute compatibility: Consult the WAI-ARIA specification or a reference like the ARIA in HTML guide to determine if the ARIA attribute is allowed for the element's role. For a generic container, the `aria-label` attribute is allowed, as it can be used to provide an accessible name for the element when it's not possible to use a native HTML feature.\n\n3. Validate the code: Use an accessibility checker or validator, such as the W3C HTML validator or aXe, to ensure the ARIA attribute is correctly implemented and follows accessibility guidelines.\n\n4. Test with assistive technologies: Use screen readers or other assistive technologies to ensure the ARIA attribute is correctly interpreted and provides the intended user experience.\n\nIn summary, the `aria-label` attribute is allowed for a `<div>` element, as it can be used to provide an accessible name for a generic container. To ensure its proper implementation, consult the WAI-ARIA specification, validate the code, and test with assistive technologies.",
  "a_aria-label": "To ensure ARIA attributes are allowed for an element's role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the role of the element: In this case, the element is an anchor tag `<a>`, which has an implicit role of \"link\".\n\n2. Check the ARIA specification for the allowed ARIA attributes for that role: Visit the W3C ARIA documentation (https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#link) and check the \"Supported States and Properties\" section for the \"link\" role. In this case, `aria-label` is listed as a supported attribute.\n\n3. Apply the ARIA attribute to the element: Since `aria-label` is allowed for the \"link\" role, you can apply it to the anchor tag as follows: `<a aria-label=\"...\"></a>`.\n\n4. Validate your markup: Use an HTML validator, such as the W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/), to ensure your markup is valid and there are no errors related to ARIA attributes.\n\n5. Test with assistive technologies: Use screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) and other assistive technologies to ensure the ARIA attribute is properly communicated to users.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the ARIA attributes you use are allowed for the element's role, improving the accessibility of your web content.",
  "div_aria-expanded": "To ensure ARIA attributes are allowed for an element's role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the element's role: In this case, the element is a `div` which by default has no specific role assigned to it. If you want to assign a role, you can add a `role` attribute to the element, like `<div role=\"button\" aria-expanded=\"false\">`.\n\n2. Check the ARIA specification: Refer to the WAI-ARIA specification to see which roles support the ARIA attribute you want to use. In this case, we want to use `aria-expanded`, which is supported by roles such as `button`, `combobox`, `link`, `treeitem`, and a few others. You can find the list of supported roles in the [WAI-ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-expanded).\n\n3. Add or modify the role if necessary: If the element's role does not support the ARIA attribute, you may need to change the role or use a different ARIA attribute. In our example, since a `div` does not have a default role, we added the `button` role to make it compatible with the `aria-expanded` attribute.\n\n4. Test with assistive technologies: Use screen readers and other assistive technologies to test the element and ensure that the ARIA attribute is properly recognized and conveyed to users.\n\nHere's the modified example with the correct role and ARIA attribute:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"button\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n  Expandable content\n</div>\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that ARIA attributes are allowed and properly used for an element's role."
