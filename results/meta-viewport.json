Additionally, it ensures that the content fits within the device's screen width and does not shrink to fit.\n\nTo make the page more accessible, the following can be added:\n\n1. Use descriptive alt text for images to provide context for users who are visually impaired or using screen readers.\n2. Use semantic HTML elements to provide a clear structure for the page.\n3. Ensure that all form elements have labels to make them accessible to users who rely on assistive technology.\n4. Use high contrast colors for text and background to make the content easier to read.\n5. Provide keyboard navigation for all interactive elements on the page to make it accessible to users who cannot use a mouse."
