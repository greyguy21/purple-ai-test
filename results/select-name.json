  "select_name": "The issue in the given code snippet is that it lacks a proper label for the select element, which is important for accessibility. To fix this issue, we can add a label element with a \"for\" attribute that matches the \"id\" attribute of the select element. Here's the correct version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<label for=\"selectElement\">Select an option:</label>\n<select name=\"...\" id=\"selectElement\">\n  <!-- Options go here -->\n</select>\n```\n\nBy adding the label element, we've provided an accessible name for the select element, making it more accessible for users who rely on screen readers and other assistive technologies."
