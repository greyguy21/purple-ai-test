  "heading-order": "Using h1 through h6 element tags in a sequentially-descending order improves accessibility by providing a clear hierarchy and structure to the content. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can easily navigate and understand the content organization. Here's an example of how to use them correctly:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Document</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Main heading (title of the page or document)</h1>\n    <section>\n        <h2>First-level subheading</h2>\n        <p>Some content related to the first-level subheading.</p>\n        \n        <section>\n            <h3>Second-level subheading</h3>\n            <p>Some content related to the second-level subheading.</p>\n            \n            <section>\n                <h4>Third-level subheading</h4>\n                <p>Some content related to the third-level subheading.</p>\n                \n                <section>\n                    <h5>Fourth-level subheading</h5>\n                    <p>Some content related to the fourth-level subheading.</p>\n                    \n                    <section>\n                        <h6>Fifth-level subheading</h6>\n                        <p>Some content related to the fifth-level subheading.</p>\n                    </section>\n                </section>\n            </section>\n        </section>\n    </section>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, the h1 through h6 elements are used in a sequentially-descending order, starting with the main heading (h1), followed by subheadings (h2 to h6) nested within sections. This provides a clear hierarchy and organization to the content, making it more accessible for users with screen readers and other assistive technologies."
