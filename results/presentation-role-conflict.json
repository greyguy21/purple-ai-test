The `tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute allows the element to be programmatically focused, but prevents it from being focused by keyboard users.\n\nExample 2: \n\nPresentational element: `<span style=\"color: red;\">Error message</span>`\n\nFix: `<span style=\"color: red;\" role=\"alert\">Error message</span>`\n\nExplanation: The `role=\"alert\"` attribute tells assistive technologies that this element contains important information that the user needs to be aware of. This is typically used for error messages or other critical alerts."
