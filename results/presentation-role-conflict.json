  "button_role_type_i": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the button element has a \"role\" attribute set to \"presentation\", which is not appropriate for a button. Additionally, the \"i\" element inside the button should have an accessible label for screen readers.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Descriptive label for the button\">\n  <i aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n</button>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the \"role\" attribute is removed from the button, and an \"aria-label\" attribute is added to provide a descriptive label for the button. The \"i\" element now has an \"aria-hidden\" attribute set to \"true\" to make it hidden from screen readers, as it's considered a presentational element."
