  "div_role=\"option\"": "To ensure valid values for common ARIA attributes, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Use the correct attribute values: Make sure to use the appropriate values for each ARIA attribute. For example, `aria-describedby` should reference an ID of an element that describes the content, `aria-hidden` should be either \"true\" or \"false\", and `role` should have a valid role value like \"option\".\n\n2. Validate the attribute values: Ensure that the values provided for each attribute are valid and make sense in the context of the element. For example, the `aria-describedby` attribute should reference an existing element on the page with a matching ID.\n\n3. Check the ARIA attribute requirements: Some ARIA attributes have specific requirements or dependencies on other attributes. Make sure to fulfill these requirements when using the attributes. For example, an element with `role=\"option\"` should be contained within an element with `role=\"listbox\"`.\n\n4. Test with screen readers: Test your implementation with different screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure that the ARIA attributes are being correctly interpreted and announced.\n\n5. Use a validator: Use an HTML and ARIA validator, like the W3C HTML Validator or the aXe accessibility testing tool, to check for any errors or warnings related to ARIA attributes.\n\nHere's an example of a valid implementation:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"option-description\">This is an option in a listbox.</div>\n<div role=\"listbox\" style=\"width: 290px;\">\n  <div aria-describedby=\"option-description\" aria-hidden=\"false\" role=\"option\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n    Option 1\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `aria-describedby` attribute references an existing element with a matching ID, the `aria-hidden` attribute has a valid value, and the `role` attribute is used correctly within the context of a `listbox`.",
  "li_role=\"presentation\"_button_role=\"button\"": "To ensure valid values for common ARIA attributes, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the appropriate element: Make sure that the element you are using is suitable for the ARIA attribute. In this case, the `li` element is being used with the `aria-controls`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-selected`, and `role` attributes, which is acceptable.\n\n2. Check attribute values: Ensure that the values provided for each ARIA attribute are valid and appropriate for the attribute. In this case:\n\n   - `aria-controls`: The value \"navigation00\" is valid if there is an element with the ID \"navigation00\" that this `li` element controls.\n   - `aria-hidden`: The value \"false\" is valid, as it indicates that the element is not hidden from assistive technologies.\n   - `aria-selected`: The value \"true\" is valid, as it indicates that the element is currently selected.\n   - `role`: The value \"presentation\" is valid, as it indicates that the element should be treated as a presentational item with no semantic meaning.\n\n3. Ensure correct attribute usage for child elements: Make sure that the child elements also use appropriate ARIA attributes with valid values. In this case, the `button` element has the `aria-required`, `role`, `tabindex`, and `type` attributes:\n\n   - `aria-required`: This attribute is not applicable to the `button` element, so it should be removed.\n   - `role`: The value \"button\" is valid, as it indicates that the element should be treated as a button.\n   - `tabindex`: The value \"0\" is valid, as it makes the button focusable and reachable using the keyboard.\n   - `type`: The value \"button\" is valid, as it specifies that the element is a button.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes, the updated code would look like this:\n\n```html\n<li aria-controls=\"navigation00\" aria-hidden=\"false\" aria-selected=\"true\" role=\"presentation\">\n  <button role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"></button>\n</li>\n```\n\n4. Validate your code: Use an ARIA validator or accessibility testing tool to ensure that your code is compliant with accessibility standards. Some popular tools include the W3C Markup Validation Service, aXe, and Lighthouse.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure valid values for common ARIA attributes and create more accessible web content.",
  "section_role=\"region\"": "To ensure valid values for common ARIA attributes, you should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Use the correct ARIA attribute: In this case, you are using `aria-labelledby` and `role`. Make sure these are the appropriate attributes for the element you are working with.\n\n2. Properly reference elements: The `aria-labelledby` attribute should reference the ID of another element on the page that serves as the label for the section. The ID should be unique and must not be used by any other element on the page. For example:\n\n```\n<h2 id=\"section-heading\">Section Title</h2>\n<section aria-labelledby=\"section-heading\" role=\"region\">\n  ...\n</section>\n```\n\n3. Use appropriate `role` values: The `role` attribute should have a valid value according to the WAI-ARIA specification. In this case, you are using `region`, which is a valid role for a section element. Make sure the role you choose accurately represents the purpose and function of the element.\n\n4. Test with screen readers: To ensure that the ARIA attributes are working correctly, test your page with popular screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. This will help you confirm that the labels and roles are being announced as expected.\n\n5. Validate your code: Use an HTML validator like the W3C Markup Validation Service or a specialized ARIA validator like the ARIA Validator bookmarklet to check for any syntax errors or invalid attribute values.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your ARIA attributes are valid and provide a better user experience for people using assistive technologies."
