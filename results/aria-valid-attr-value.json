  "section_role=\"region\"": "To ensure valid values for common ARIA attributes, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Use the correct ARIA attribute: Make sure you are using the correct ARIA attribute for the element. In this case, you are using `aria-labelledby` for a `section` element with a `role` of \"region\". This is appropriate as it helps to label the region for screen reader users.\n\n2. Reference an existing element: The value of `aria-labelledby` should be the ID of an existing element on the page that serves as the label for the region. Ensure that the element you're referencing exists and has a unique ID.\n\n3. Use a descriptive label: The element referenced by `aria-labelledby` should have a descriptive and meaningful text content that accurately describes the content or purpose of the region.\n\n4. Unique IDs: Make sure the ID used in `aria-labelledby` is unique on the page. Duplicate IDs can cause confusion for screen readers and may result in the wrong label being announced.\n\n5. Use `aria-label` as an alternative: If there is no suitable element to serve as a label, you can use the `aria-label` attribute instead. This allows you to provide a label directly on the `section` element. However, it is generally better to use `aria-labelledby` when possible, as it allows for better flexibility and maintainability.\n\nHere's an example of correct usage:\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"news-heading\">Latest News</h2>\n<section aria-labelledby=\"news-heading\" role=\"region\">\n  <!-- Content of the region -->\n</section>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `aria-labelledby` attribute references the ID of the `h2` element, which serves as a descriptive label for the region."
