  "li_role=\"tab\"": "To ensure valid values for common ARIA attributes on an `li` element, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use a valid ID for the `aria-controls` attribute: The value of the `aria-controls` attribute should match the ID of the element that this `li` element controls. In this case, the value is \"mmid-cpf-overview\", which should be the ID of the element being controlled by this `li` element (e.g., a tab panel). Make sure the ID is unique within the document.\n\n2. Use a valid value for the `aria-selected` attribute: The `aria-selected` attribute indicates whether the `li` element is currently selected. It should have a value of either \"true\" or \"false\". In this case, the value is \"true\", which means the `li` element is currently selected.\n\n3. Use a valid value for the `role` attribute: The `role` attribute specifies the role of the `li` element in the context of the user interface. In this case, the role is \"tab\", which means the `li` element serves as a tab within a tablist. Ensure that the `role` attribute value is appropriate for the intended use of the element.\n\n4. Make sure the `li` element is part of a parent element with a `role` of \"tablist\": The `li` element should be a child of an element with a `role` attribute value of \"tablist\". This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and relationship between the `li` elements and their corresponding tab panels.\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<ul role=\"tablist\">\n  <li aria-controls=\"mmid-cpf-overview\" aria-selected=\"true\" role=\"tab\">CPF Overview</li>\n  <li aria-controls=\"mmid-cpf-details\" aria-selected=\"false\" role=\"tab\">CPF Details</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div id=\"mmid-cpf-overview\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n  <!-- CPF Overview content -->\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"mmid-cpf-details\" role=\"tabpanel\" hidden>\n  <!-- CPF Details content -->\n</div>\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure valid values for common ARIA attributes on an `li` element and improve the accessibility of your web content."
