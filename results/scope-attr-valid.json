The \"Category\" header cell has a scope of \"col\" because it applies to all the cells in the first column. The \"Amount\" header cell also has a scope of \"col\" because it applies to all the cells in the second column.\n\nTo make this table more accessible, we can also add the following attributes:\n\n- <caption> element to provide a brief description of the table\n- <thead> and <tbody> elements to group"
