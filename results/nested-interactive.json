  "li_aria-controls_aria-selected_data-analytics-click-id_data-analytics-section_data-analytics-text_role": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `aria-controls` and `aria-selected` attributes, as they are typically used for controlling tabbed interfaces which require nested interactivity. The `role` attribute can also be removed as it is not necessary without the tabbed interface. The modified snippet would look like this:\n\n`<li data-analytics-click-id=\"GlobalHeaderL2Link\" data-analytics-section=\"Global Header\" data-analytics-text=\"CPF overview\">`",
  "div_role": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove any interactive elements within the `div` with `role=\"option\"`. For example:\n\n```\n<div role=\"option\">\n  This is an option\n</div>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could use a different HTML element that is not interactive, such as a `span`, to wrap the content within the `div` with `role=\"option\"`. For example:\n\n```\n<div role=\"option\">\n  <span>This is an option</span>\n</div>\n```",
  "div_aria-label_data-aos-delay_data-aos_role_style": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `role` attribute. The `role` attribute is used to define the purpose of an element, and in this case, it is defining the element as a slider, which implies interactivity. Removing this attribute would make the element less interactive.\n\nAnother way to reduce interactivity is to remove the `data-aos` and `data-aos-delay` attributes. These attributes are used by the AOS library to add animation effects to elements when they are scrolled into view. Removing these attributes would make the element less dynamic and interactive.\n\nFinally, the `style` attribute could be removed or modified to reduce the visual impact of the element. The `margin-top` and `padding-top` properties are used to position the element on the page, and removing or adjusting them could make the element less prominent and interactive.",
  "div_aria-label_role": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to use the `tabindex` attribute instead of the `role` attribute. For example:\n\n```\n<div aria-label=\"...\" tabindex=\"0\">\n```\n\nThis will make the `div` element focusable and allow users to interact with it using keyboard navigation, without creating nested interactive elements.",
  "div_role_tabindex": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `role` and `tabindex` attributes from the `div` element and use a `button` element instead. The `button` element is already interactive by default and does not require additional attributes to be added for accessibility. \n\nExample: \n\n```\n<button>Click me</button>\n```",
  "button_a_href": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `button` element and use the `a` element as the clickable element instead. This can be achieved by adding CSS styles to the `a` element to make it look like a button. For example:\n\n`<a href=\"...\" class=\"button-link\">Button Text</a>`\n\nAnd in the CSS:\n\n`.button-link {\n  display: inline-block;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  background-color: #007bff;\n  color: #fff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}`\n\nThis will create a clickable link that looks like a button, without the need for nested interactivity.",
  "div_role_p_a_aria-expanded_href_role": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `p` element and use the `a` element directly inside the `div` element with the `role` attribute set to \"tab\". This would result in the following code:\n\n```\n<div role=\"tab\">\n  <a aria-expanded=\"false\" href=\"...\" role=\"button\"></a>\n</div>\n``` \n\nAnother way is to remove the `a` element and use a `button` element instead, which can also have the `role` attribute set to \"button\". This would result in the following code:\n\n```\n<div role=\"tab\">\n  <button aria-expanded=\"false\" type=\"button\"></button>\n</div>\n```",
  "span_onclick_role_a_href_u": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `onclick` attribute from the `span` element and add it to the `a` element instead. This way, the `a` element will be the only one with interactivity. The updated code would look like this:\n\n`<span role=\"button\"><a href=\"...\" onclick=\"\"><u></u></a></span>`",
  "div_role_style": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `role` attribute and the `style` attribute. This would result in a simple `div` element with no special roles or styles:\n\n```\n<div> </div>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could move the interactivity to a separate element that is not nested within the `div`. For example, you could use JavaScript to add a click event listener to the `div` element:\n\n```\n<div id=\"myTab\"> </div>\n\n<script>\n  var tab = document.getElementById(\"myTab\");\n  tab.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n    // do something when the tab is clicked\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nThis way, the interactivity is not nested within the `div` element, but is still associated with it."
