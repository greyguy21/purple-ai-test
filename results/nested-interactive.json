  "li_aria-controls_aria-selected_data-analytics-click-id_data-analytics-section_data-analytics-text_role": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `aria-controls` and `aria-selected` attributes, as they are typically used for controlling tabbed interfaces which require nested interactivity. The `role` attribute can also be removed as it is not necessary without the tabbed interface. The modified snippet would look like this:\n\n`<li data-analytics-click-id=\"GlobalHeaderL2Link\" data-analytics-section=\"Global Header\" data-analytics-text=\"CPF overview\">`",
  "div_role": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove any interactive elements within the `div` with `role=\"option\"`. For example:\n\n```\n<div role=\"option\">\n  This is an option\n</div>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could use a different HTML element that is not interactive, such as a `span`, to wrap the content within the `div` with `role=\"option\"`. For example:\n\n```\n<div role=\"option\">\n  <span>This is an option</span>\n</div>\n```",
  "div_aria-label_data-aos-delay_data-aos_role_style": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to remove the `role` attribute. The `role` attribute is used to define the purpose of an element, and in this case, it is defining the element as a slider, which implies interactivity. Removing this attribute would make the element less interactive.\n\nAnother way to reduce interactivity is to remove the `data-aos` and `data-aos-delay` attributes. These attributes are used by the AOS library to add animation effects to elements when they are scrolled into view. Removing these attributes would make the element less dynamic and interactive.\n\nFinally, the `style` attribute could be removed or modified to reduce the visual impact of the element. The `margin-top` and `padding-top` properties are used to position the element on the page, and removing or adjusting them could make the element less prominent and interactive.",
  "div_aria-label_role": "One way to make this snippet not have nested interactivity is to use the `tabindex` attribute instead of the `role` attribute. For example:\n\n```\n<div aria-label=\"...\" tabindex=\"0\">\n```\n\nThis will make the `div` element focusable and allow users to interact with it using keyboard navigation, without creating nested interactive elements."
