  "li_aria-controls_aria-selected_role": "To ensure that the snippet has no nested interactivity, you should check that there are no interactive elements (such as buttons, links, or form elements) inside the `<li>` element. The snippet should look like this:\n\n```\n<li aria-controls=\"mmid-cpf-overview\" aria-selected=\"false\" role=\"tab\">\n  <!-- Make sure there are no interactive elements here -->\n</li>\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you are using JavaScript, ensure that there are no event listeners attached to any elements inside the `<li>` element that may cause interactivity."
