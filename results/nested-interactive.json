  "button_aria-disabled_href": "You can ensure that there is no nested interactivity in this snippet by removing any interactive elements inside the button, such as links or other buttons. Additionally, you can use the `aria-disabled` attribute to indicate that the button is disabled and not interactive. Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<button aria-disabled=\"true\">Disabled Button</button>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `href` attribute has been removed since it's not appropriate for a button element. The `aria-disabled` attribute is set to \"true\" to indicate that the button is disabled and not interactive.",
  "div_aria-describedby_aria-hidden_role_style_tabindex": "To ensure that the snippet has no nested interactivity, you should check the content within the `<div>` element and make sure it contains no interactive elements such as buttons, links, or form elements. The snippet should look like this:\n\n```\n<div aria-describedby=\"...\" aria-hidden=\"false\" role=\"option\" style=\"width: 290px;\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n  <!-- Ensure no interactive elements are present here -->\n</div>\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `aria-activedescendant` attribute on the container element to manage focus within the composite widget, instead of using `tabindex=\"-1\"` on the `<div>` element."
