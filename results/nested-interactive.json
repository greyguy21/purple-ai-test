  "li_aria-controls_aria-selected_role": "To ensure this snippet has no nested interactivity, make sure there are no interactive elements such as buttons, links, or form inputs inside the `<li>` element. The snippet should look like this:\n\n```html\n<li aria-controls=\"mmid-cpf-overview\" aria-selected=\"false\" role=\"tab\">\n  <!-- Add non-interactive content here, such as text or images -->\n</li>\n```\n\nBy keeping interactive elements out of the `<li>` element with `role=\"tab\"`, you can avoid nested interactivity issues."
