To fix this, we can use `aria-label` to provide a descriptive label for the navigation landmark.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<nav aria-label=\"Main navigation\">\n  <!-- Navigation content -->\n</nav>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `<nav>` element has been given an accessible label \"Main navigation\" using the `aria-label` attribute.
