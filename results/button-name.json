  "button-name": "Here's an example of a button with `aria-label` attribute:\n\n```html\n<button aria-label=\"Close dialog\" onclick=\"closeDialog();\">\n  <span>&times;</span>\n</button>\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a button that is used to close a dialog. The button contains a \"Ã—\" character as its content, which might not be very informative for screen reader users. By adding the `aria-label` attribute with the value \"Close dialog\", we provide a more descriptive label for screen reader users, so they can understand the purpose of the button.\n\nHere's an example of a button with `aria-labelledby` attribute:\n\n```html\n<button id=\"submitBtn\" aria-labelledby=\"submitBtnText\">\n  <span id=\"submitBtnText\">Submit form</span>\n</button>\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a button that is used to submit a form. The button contains a text \"Submit form\" as its content. By adding the `aria-labelledby` attribute with the value \"submitBtnText\", we associate the button with the text inside the `<span>` element with the ID \"submitBtnText\". This way, screen reader users will hear the \"Submit form\" label when the button is focused, providing a clear understanding of the button's purpose."
