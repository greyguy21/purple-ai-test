  "form_role=\"form\"": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the element's role is necessary: In this case, the `<form>` element has an implicit role of \"form\" by default, so adding the `role=\"form\"` attribute is redundant. You can simply use `<form>` without the role attribute.\n\n2. Verify the role value: If you still want to add an ARIA role, ensure that the role value is valid according to the ARIA specifications. You can find a list of valid ARIA roles in the [W3C ARIA documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions).\n\n3. Use the correct element: Make sure you are using the appropriate HTML element for the role. In this case, the `<form>` element is the correct choice for a form role.\n\n4. Ensure proper nesting and structure: Verify that the element with the ARIA role is placed correctly within the structure of your HTML document, and that it follows the rules for its specific role.\n\n5. Test with assistive technologies: Use accessibility testing tools and screen readers to ensure that the element with the ARIA role is correctly identified and announced to users.\n\nIn summary, for the given example, you don't need to add the `role=\"form\"` attribute to the `<form>` element, as it already has an implicit role of \"form\". Simply use `<form>` instead."
