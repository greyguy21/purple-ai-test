  "form_role=\"form\"": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the element already has an implicit role: HTML elements like `<form>` already have an implicit role of \"form\". Adding a `role` attribute with the same value is redundant and not necessary. In this case, you can simply use `<form>` without adding the `role=\"form\"` attribute.\n\n2. Verify the role value: If you still want to use the `role` attribute, ensure that the value you provide is a valid ARIA role. You can refer to the list of ARIA roles in the WAI-ARIA specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles\n\n3. Use the role attribute correctly: When using the `role` attribute, ensure that it is used correctly according to the ARIA specification and best practices. For example, do not use a `role` value that conflicts with the element's default semantics or use a role that is not supported by the element.\n\n4. Test with screen readers: To ensure that the ARIA role is correctly applied and recognized by assistive technologies, test your web page with different screen readers like JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver.\n\n5. Validate your HTML: Use an HTML validator like the W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/) to check if your HTML code is valid and follows accessibility guidelines. This can help you identify any issues with your ARIA roles and other accessibility features.\n\nIn summary, for the `<form>` element, you don't need to add the `role=\"form\"` attribute, as it already has an implicit role of \"form\". However, if you want to use the `role` attribute, make sure it is a valid ARIA role and follow the best practices and guidelines for using ARIA roles."
