  "section_aria-labelledby_role": "To ensure that the element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the correct ARIA role attribute: In this case, the `role` attribute is set to \"region\", which is a valid ARIA role for a section element. You can refer to the list of valid ARIA roles in the WAI-ARIA specification to make sure you are using the correct role.\n\n2. Use the appropriate ARIA attributes: In this case, the `aria-labelledby` attribute is used to provide a label for the section element. Make sure that the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute corresponds to the `id` of an element that contains the label text for the section. This ensures that screen readers can properly announce the label when the section is focused.\n\n3. Check the nesting of ARIA roles: Make sure that the ARIA roles you use are allowed within the parent element's role. In this case, the \"region\" role can be used within most container elements, so it should be fine.\n\n4. Validate the HTML and ARIA markup: Use an HTML validator like the W3C Markup Validation Service and an ARIA validator like the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide to check for any errors or warnings related to your ARIA roles and attributes.\n\n5. Test with screen readers: Test your markup with different screen readers (such as NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver) to ensure that the ARIA roles and attributes are correctly announced and that users can navigate and interact with the content as expected.",
  "section_role": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Verify that the ARIA role is appropriate for the element. In this case, the `<section>` element has a `role=\"region\"` attribute, which is a valid ARIA role for a section element. The `region` role is used to identify a large section of content that is relevant to the user and should be considered as a single unit.\n\n2. Make sure that the element with the ARIA role has all the required attributes. For the `region` role, it is necessary to have an accessible name provided by either the `aria-labelledby` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute. For example:\n\n   ```html\n   <section role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"sectionTitle\">\n     <h1 id=\"sectionTitle\">Section Title</h1>\n     <!-- Section content -->\n   </section>\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```html\n   <section role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Section Title\">\n     <!-- Section content -->\n   </section>\n   ```\n\n3. Check that the ARIA role does not conflict with the native semantics of the element. In this case, the `<section>` element has a native semantic meaning, but adding the `role=\"region\"` does not conflict with that meaning. However, if the ARIA role you are adding to an element conflicts with its native semantics, it may cause issues with assistive technologies.\n\n4. Test the element with assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to ensure that it is properly announced and understood by users. This will help you identify any issues that may not be apparent from just looking at the code.\n\n5. Validate your HTML code using an HTML validator, such as the W3C Markup Validation Service, to ensure that there are no syntax errors or other issues that could cause problems with assistive technologies.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your element has a valid ARIA role and is accessible to users with assistive technologies."
