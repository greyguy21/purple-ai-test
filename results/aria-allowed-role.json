  "form_role=\"form\"": "To ensure that an element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Verify that the ARIA role is appropriate for the element: In this case, the `form` element has a `role=\"form\"` attribute. Since the `form` element already has an implicit role of form, adding `role=\"form\"` is redundant but not incorrect.\n\n2. Check if the ARIA role is allowed on the element: According to the WAI-ARIA specification, the `form` role can be used on elements with a native semantics of `form`. So, it is allowed in this case.\n\n3. Ensure that required ARIA attributes are provided: The `form` role does not have any required attributes, so you don't need to add any additional attributes in this case.\n\n4. Make sure that the ARIA role does not conflict with the native semantics: As mentioned earlier, the `form` element has an implicit role of form, so adding `role=\"form\"` does not conflict with the native semantics.\n\nSo, the given element `<form role=\"form\">` is valid and has an appropriate ARIA role. However, since the `form` element already has an implicit role of form, you can simplify the element to just `<form>` without any loss of accessibility information.",
  "label_role=\"radio\"": "To ensure that an element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the element has a valid ARIA role attribute: In the given example, the element has a `role` attribute with the value \"radio\", which is a valid ARIA role for a radio button.\n\n2. Verify that the ARIA attributes are appropriate for the role: For a radio button, the appropriate ARIA attributes are `aria-checked`, `aria-label`, and `aria-required`. In the given example, all these attributes are present with valid values.\n\n3. Make sure that the element uses the correct native HTML element or a suitable fallback: In this case, the element should ideally be an `<input>` element with the `type` attribute set to \"radio\". However, if you're using a custom element, ensure that you provide a suitable fallback using the `tabindex` attribute (as done in the example) to make it keyboard accessible.\n\n4. Test the element with a screen reader or other assistive technology to ensure that it is correctly announcing the role and attributes: This will help you confirm that the ARIA role and attributes are working as expected.\n\nHere's an updated version of your example using the `<input>` element:\n\n```html\n<label>\n  <input\n    type=\"radio\"\n    name=\"...\"\n    aria-checked=\"false\"\n    aria-label=\"...\"\n    aria-required=\"true\"\n    role=\"radio\"\n    tabindex=\"0\"\n    title=\"...\"\n  >\n  Radio button label\n</label>\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that an element has a valid ARIA role and is accessible to users with assistive technologies.",
  "option_role=\"none\"": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the element's native semantics already provide the desired role. In the case of the `<option>` element, it has a native role of \"option\" within a `<select>` element or a listbox role within a `<datalist>` element. Therefore, there is no need to add an ARIA role attribute.\n\n2. If you still want to override the native role, make sure you're using a valid ARIA role. In this case, \"none\" is not a valid role for the `<option>` element. A valid role would be \"option\" or \"presentation\" if you want to remove the semantics of the element.\n\n3. Ensure that the role you choose is appropriate for the context in which the element is used. For example, if the `<option>` element is inside a `<select>` or `<datalist>` element, the role \"option\" would be appropriate.\n\n4. Validate your code using an accessibility tool, such as the W3C HTML validator or aXe by Deque, to ensure that the ARIA role is correctly implemented.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct code for an `<option>` element with a valid ARIA role would be:\n\n```html\n<option value=\"...\"></option>\n```\n\nOr, if you want to override the native semantics and remove the role:\n\n```html\n<option role=\"presentation\" value=\"...\"></option>\n```\n\nHowever, it's generally best to rely on the native semantics of the element and avoid using ARIA roles unless absolutely necessary."
