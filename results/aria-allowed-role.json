  "form_role=\"form\"": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the element already has an implicit role: HTML elements like `<form>` already have an implicit role of \"form\". Adding a `role` attribute with the same value is redundant and not necessary. In this case, you can simply use `<form>` without adding the `role=\"form\"` attribute.\n\n2. Verify the role value: If you still want to use the `role` attribute, ensure that the value you provide is a valid ARIA role. You can refer to the list of ARIA roles in the WAI-ARIA specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles\n\n3. Use the role attribute correctly: When using the `role` attribute, ensure that it is used correctly according to the ARIA specification and best practices. For example, do not use a `role` value that conflicts with the element's default semantics or use a role that is not supported by the element.\n\n4. Test with screen readers: To ensure that the ARIA role is correctly applied and recognized by assistive technologies, test your web page with different screen readers like JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver.\n\n5. Validate your HTML: Use an HTML validator like the W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/) to check if your HTML code is valid and follows accessibility guidelines. This can help you identify any issues with your ARIA roles and other accessibility features.\n\nIn summary, for the `<form>` element, you don't need to add the `role=\"form\"` attribute, as it already has an implicit role of \"form\". However, if you want to use the `role` attribute, make sure it is a valid ARIA role and follow the best practices and guidelines for using ARIA roles.",
  "label_role=\"radio\"": "To ensure that an element has a valid ARIA role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure the element has a valid ARIA role attribute: In this case, the element has the `role=\"radio\"` attribute, which is a valid ARIA role.\n\n2. Ensure that the element has all the required ARIA attributes for its role: For a radio button, the required ARIA attributes are `aria-checked` and `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label`. In this example, the element has both `aria-checked` and `aria-label` attributes.\n\n3. Verify that the ARIA attributes have valid values: The `aria-checked` attribute should have a value of \"true\" or \"false\", and in this case, it has a value of \"false\". The `aria-label` attribute should have a non-empty string value, and in this case, it has a value of \"...\". Replace the \"...\" with a meaningful description of the radio button.\n\n4. Check for any additional ARIA attributes that might be necessary for the element: In this case, the element also has the `aria-required` attribute with a value of \"true\", which indicates that the radio button is required for form submission.\n\n5. Ensure that the element has a valid `tabindex` attribute: In this case, the element has a `tabindex` of \"0\", which is a valid value and allows the element to be focusable.\n\n6. Make sure the element has a valid HTML `name` attribute: In this case, the element has a `name` attribute with a value of \"...\". Replace the \"...\" with a meaningful name for the radio button.\n\n7. Verify that the element has a valid `title` attribute: In this case, the element has a `title` attribute with a value of \"...\". Replace the \"...\" with a meaningful description of the radio button.\n\nAfter following these steps, the updated element should look like this:\n\n```html\n<label aria-checked=\"false\" aria-label=\"Your meaningful description\" aria-required=\"true\" name=\"your-meaningful-name\" role=\"radio\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Your meaningful description\">\n```\n\nThis element now has a valid ARIA role and all the necessary attributes for a radio button.",
  "option_role=\"none\"": "To ensure that an element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the element has a default implicit ARIA role. In this case, the `<option>` element has a default role of \"option\".\n\n2. If the element has an explicit ARIA role specified using the `role` attribute, verify that it is an allowed role for the element. According to the ARIA in HTML specification, the `<option>` element should not have any explicit role other than its default role.\n\n3. In this case, the `role` attribute has a value of \"none\". This is not an allowed role for the `<option>` element. To ensure the element has a valid ARIA role, you should remove the `role` attribute or change its value to \"option\":\n\n```html\n<option value=\"...\"></option>\n```\n\nor\n\n```html\n<option role=\"option\" value=\"...\"></option>\n```\n\n4. Always refer to the ARIA in HTML specification and the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices to ensure you are using the correct ARIA roles and attributes for a specific element."
