  "section_aria-labelledby_role": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure that the element you're using supports the ARIA role you're assigning. In this case, the `section` element supports the `region` role, so you're good to go.\n\n2. Check that the role you're using is a valid ARIA role. The `region` role is a valid ARIA role, so you're fine here as well.\n\n3. Ensure that the ARIA attribute you're using is valid for the element and role. In this case, the `aria-labelledby` attribute is valid for the `section` element with the `region` role.\n\n4. Make sure that the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute is a valid ID reference. The ID should be unique within the page and should be assigned to an element that acts as a label for the section.\n\nHere's an example of a correct implementation:\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"section-title\">My Section Title</h2>\n<section aria-labelledby=\"section-title\" role=\"region\">\n  <!-- Your content here -->\n</section>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `section` element has a valid role of `region` and the `aria-labelledby` attribute points to the ID of the `h2` element, which acts as a label for the section.",
  "section_role": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the element is an appropriate use of the ARIA role: In this case, the `section` element has a `role` attribute with the value \"region\". The \"region\" role is used to identify a large, perceivable section of a web page or document, so using it with a `section` element is appropriate.\n\n2. Make sure the element has an accessible name: Elements with a \"region\" role must have an accessible name to make them understandable to screen reader users. You can provide an accessible name using the `aria-labelledby` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute. For example:\n\n   ```html\n   <section role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"section-title\">\n     <h2 id=\"section-title\">Section Title</h2>\n     <!-- section content -->\n   </section>\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```html\n   <section role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Section Title\">\n     <h2>Section Title</h2>\n     <!-- section content -->\n   </section>\n   ```\n\n3. Validate your HTML and ARIA markup: Use an HTML validator like the W3C Markup Validation Service and an ARIA validator like the ARIA Validator bookmarklet to check for any errors or warnings related to your ARIA roles and attributes.\n\n4. Test with a screen reader: Finally, test your webpage with a screen reader like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to ensure that the element is announced correctly and the accessible name is read out.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your `section` element with a \"region\" role is valid and accessible."
