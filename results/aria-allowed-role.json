  "section_aria-labelledby_role": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the correct HTML element: Make sure you are using an appropriate HTML element for the content or functionality you are trying to convey. In this case, you are using a `<section>` element which is suitable for a thematic grouping of content.\n\n2. Use a valid ARIA role: Ensure that the ARIA role you are using is valid and appropriate for the element. In this case, you are using the \"region\" role, which is a valid ARIA role for a section element.\n\n3. Add an accessible name: Make sure the element has an accessible name using an appropriate method. In this case, you are using the `aria-labelledby` attribute to reference the ID of another element that provides the accessible name for the region.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `section` element with the `aria-labelledby` attribute and the `role` attribute set to \"region\":\n\n```html\n<h2 id=\"section-heading\">Section Heading</h2>\n<section aria-labelledby=\"section-heading\" role=\"region\">\n  <!-- Your section content goes here -->\n</section>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `aria-labelledby` attribute refers to the ID of the `<h2>` element, which provides an accessible name for the region.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your element has a valid ARIA role and is accessible to screen reader users.",
  "section_role": "To ensure an element has a valid ARIA role, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the role attribute is correctly set: Make sure the role attribute is set to a valid ARIA role. In this case, the role is set to \"region\", which is a valid ARIA role.\n\n   Example: <section role=\"region\">\n\n2. Use an appropriate element: Ensure that the element you're using is appropriate for the role. In this case, the \"section\" element is appropriate for the \"region\" role, as it represents a significant, standalone part of the content.\n\n3. Provide a label: For elements with a \"region\" role, it's important to provide an accessible label using the \"aria-labelledby\" or \"aria-label\" attribute. This helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region.\n\n   Example: <section role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"section-title\">\n               <h2 id=\"section-title\">Section Title</h2>\n               <!-- Section content -->\n            </section>\n\n   Or: <section role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Section Description\">\n            <!-- Section content -->\n        </section>\n\n4. Validate your code: Use an HTML validator or accessibility testing tool, such as W3C's HTML validator or axe by Deque, to check if your code is valid and accessible.\n\n5. Test with a screen reader: To ensure that your element is accessible, test it with a screen reader, such as NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver. This will help you confirm that the ARIA role is correctly applied and that the label is announced as expected."
