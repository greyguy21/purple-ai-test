  "label": "To ensure a form element has a label that is semantically correct and accessible, you should use the `<label>` element and associate it with the form control using the `for` attribute. The `for` attribute should have the same value as the `id` attribute of the form control.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<form>\n  <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"username\" required>\n  \n  <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n  <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"useremail\" required>\n  \n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n</form>\n```\n\nIn this example, we have two form elements: a text input for the user's name and an email input for the user's email address. Each form control has an associated `<label>` element with a `for` attribute that matches the `id` attribute of the corresponding form control. This ensures that the labels are semantically correct and accessible for screen readers and other assistive technologies."
