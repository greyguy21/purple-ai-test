  "label": "To ensure a form element has a label that is semantically correct and accessible, you should use the `<label>` element and associate it with the form control using the `for` attribute. The `for` attribute should have the same value as the `id` attribute of the form control.\n\nHere's an example of a form element with a semantically correct and accessible label:\n\n```html\n<form>\n  <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" required>\n  \n  <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n  <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" required>\n  \n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nIn this example, we have two form controls: an input for the username and an input for the password. Each control has a label associated with it using the `for` attribute. The `for` attribute's value matches the `id` attribute of the corresponding form control, ensuring that the label is semantically correct and accessible for screen readers and other assistive technologies."
