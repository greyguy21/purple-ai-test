  "input_tabindex_value": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the form element (input) does not have a label associated with it. This can be problematic for screen reader users, as they rely on labels to understand the purpose of form elements.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can add a <label> element and associate it with the input using the \"for\" attribute. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<label for=\"input-id\">Label text:</label>\n<input id=\"input-id\" tabindex=\"0\" value=\"...\">\n```\n\nIn this example, replace \"Label text\" with the appropriate text for the input, and \"input-id\" with a unique ID for the input element.",
  "input_type_value": "Issue: The input form element does not have an associated label, which can cause accessibility problems for users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies.\n\nCorrected code snippet:\n\n```html\n<label for=\"input-text\">Label Text:</label>\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"input-text\" value=\"...\">\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, a label element is added with the \"for\" attribute that matches the \"id\" attribute of the input element. This associates the label with the input and improves accessibility."
